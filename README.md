# Processing-Games
A short series of projects I've made using Processing Language.

In my first (and so far, only) year of univeristy , I undertook a unit titled "Introduction to Computer Programming" in which Processing was the language that was chosen. Taken straight from their website [https://processing.org], "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts"

The unit consisted of various lessons that we involved learning the Foundations of Programing, Variables & Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Compound Data, and Programming Design & Problem Solving. I had previously done some coding in high school (HTML, CSS & Python), so I knew the bare basics. The assessment was to create a golf game which involved a moving player, shooting balls, and storing the balls in arrays. Overall, I found the unit quite fun, achieving a High Distinction (HD) so I decided to continue using Processing to create mini games.

The games are as such:
