# Processing-Games
A short series of projects I've made using Processing Language.

In my first (and so far, only) year of univeristy , I undertook a unit titled "Introduction to Computer Programming" in which Processing was the language that was chosen. Taken straight from their website [https://processing.org], "Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."

The unit consisted of various lessons that we involved learning the Foundations of Programing, Variables & Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Compound Data, and Programming Design & Problem Solving. I had previously done some coding in high school (HTML, CSS & Python), so I knew the bare basics. The assessment was to create a golf game which involved a moving player, shooting balls, and storing the balls in arrays. Overall, I found the unit quite fun, achieving a High Distinction (HD) so I decided to continue using Processing to create mini games.

The games are as such: <br>
* BallDodger (Mouse): Navigate your ball around the screen using your mouse, avoiding the green balls moving around. Your ball grows with size until you finally colide and the game finishes. <br>
* BallSeeker (Arrows): Navigate your ball around the screen using your arrow keys on the diagonals, coliding with the other ball to grow in size. Your ball grows with size until you finally grow too big and win the game. <br>
* BallsScreensaver: Lots of multiple balls floating around the screen, moving around and colliding. <br>
* DVD Logo: Imagine the traditional DVD logo floating around your screen. Boom! <br>
